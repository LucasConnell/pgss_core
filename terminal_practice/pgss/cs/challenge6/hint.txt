Sometimes, you'll have to learn a new skill in order to solve a challenge. 

Let's learn about "grep"! 

The terminal command grep lets you search text. This is especially useful if you have a ton of text to search through...

grep takes two arguments, a word to find and a file to search. Here's the general form: 
grep [word] [file] 



To find the word "the" (and everything else on that line), run 

grep the big_honkin_file
